The FirePATHS project aims to evaluate the evolution of fire danger under different scenarios of emissions concentration and forest management through the explicit interaction of the climate-vegetation-fire system. For this purpose, a methodological framework is proposed that combines different simulation models of the elements of this system. The core of the process lies in the modelling of vegetation dynamics at stand scale according to different trajectories of climate evolution in order to characterise the state and typology of fuels and the subsequent simulation of potential fire behaviour. The characterization of the fire danger will combine both the temporal evolution of the fire behavior and the occurrence of extreme events, characterized by the probability of a fire occurring and exceeding the containment capacity. This is a novel strategy to evaluate the possible future trajectories under the current context of global change, providing a more complete and realistic view focused especially on developing a framework for forest management aimed at mitigating fire risk. In this sense, the methodology will allow to evaluate, among others, the potential for burning intensity, canopy fire probability, carbon emissions or the duration of the fire season. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide and evaluate effective management strategies for fire risk mitigation based on the main narratives and lines of intervention in the European context (promotion of the use of biomass, ecosystem services or fuel management through prescribed burns).
